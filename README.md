# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis involves the process of aquiring a given dataset and all the process carried out to derive valuable insights about it. Insights are derived through statistical methods and graphic visualization, in this case with the aide of some Python programming libraries.

The Dataset for this project is a csv file downloaded from Kaggle. It contains over 400,000 samples of used and some new cars up for sale on craigslist.org. The project was carried out on jupyter notebook, an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. 

## Procedures
The project was carried out in 4 stages.

- Install and Import Libraries:
  Python libraries such as numpy and pandas are install and imported for manipulating numerical and tabular data respectively. We use the opendatasets library for downloading the   dataset from kaggle by parsing the dataset URL into it. For visualization, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and folium are installed.
- Data Cleaning and Preparation:
  This includes making statistical hypothesis and findings, discovering and handling invalid data entries, such as negative or zero prices for cars as well as removing or adding     columns that we feel might or might not be useful in answering relevant questions.
  
- Data Visualization:
  To gain more insight as to the relationship between various columns, with the aide of matplotlib, plotly, seaborn and folium, we create line charts, histograms, piecharts, etc.
